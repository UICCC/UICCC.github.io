        <p> Always be true to your own sense of
            style, if you don’t you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is
            about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their
            new lines. Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously, you want to
            look good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
